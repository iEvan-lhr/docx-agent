// The Shape Definitions and Attributes portion of the DrawingML framework deals with all geometric properties for shapes within a document. This includes both preset geometries that publicly are interpreted by the generating application and custom geometries that have their points and curves explicitly specified. In addition to the underlying geometry of the shape there are also other coordinate-based properties for each shape that this framework describes.
